  <!-- here, the invoqued event "clickGoToDetails, that calls a method existing in the 'movies.ts'file called:
  goToMovieDetails"... it's called like if it were an existing event, but this is just an event emmited by the child 
  component invoqued, in this case, the card-list. The CardListComponent class has an output attribute: 
  "@Output() clickGoToDetails: any = new EventEmitter();", (clickGoToDetails is the event launched, that's why here 
  we called an event with that name'). On the click event on an item in the CardListComponent html, there is a method 
  called viewDetails that when called, uses the EventEmitterObject, in this case clickGoToDetails, and emit the event so the
  parent Component, in this case movies component, can trigger it. Fucking weird, isn't it' -->
  <card-list [items]="movies" (clickGoToDetails)="goToMovieDetails($event, movie)"></card-list>
